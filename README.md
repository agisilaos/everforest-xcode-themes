# Everforest Xcode Themes üå≤

Beautiful, eye-friendly color themes for Xcode based on the popular [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) color scheme.

## Why I Created This Project

As a developer who spends countless hours in Xcode, I was looking for a color scheme that would be gentle on my eyes during long coding sessions. After discovering the amazing Everforest theme in other editors, I noticed there wasn't an official Xcode port. This project brings the natural, warm aesthetics of Everforest to Xcode developers, maintaining the same carefully crafted color relationships that make the original theme so popular.

Everforest is designed to protect developers' eyes with its soft contrast and warm tones, making it perfect for those late-night coding sessions or anyone sensitive to harsh color schemes.

## Theme Variants

This package includes all 6 official Everforest theme variations:

### üåô Dark Themes
- **Everforest Dark Hard** - Highest contrast dark theme for maximum clarity
- **Everforest Dark Medium** - Balanced contrast dark theme (recommended)
- **Everforest Dark Soft** - Lowest contrast dark theme for minimal eye strain

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Light Themes
- **Everforest Light Hard** - Highest contrast light theme for bright environments
- **Everforest Light Medium** - Balanced contrast light theme (recommended)
- **Everforest Light Soft** - Lowest contrast light theme for gentle viewing
